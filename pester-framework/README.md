# Pester Framework

Pester is a testing and mocking framework for PowerShell.

Pester provides a framework for writing and running tests. Pester is most commonly used for writing unit and integration tests, but it is not limited to just that. It is also a base for tools that validate whole environments, computer deployments, database configurations and so on.

## Installing Pester

Pester is a cross-platform module that runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS and anywhere else supported by PowerShell.

To install follow the guidance here: <https://pester.dev/docs/introduction/installation>

## Getting Started and more information

Refer to original documentation on Pester dev site: <https://pester.dev/docs/quick-start>

NOTE: Pester is a PowerShell unit testing and mocking framework for backend logic, not for simulating user interactions like clicking buttons or selecting from dropdowns in a graphical user interface (GUI). To interact with  GUI and perform actions like mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or visual elements on a screen, you'd use other tools like Selenium/Playwright (for web), UI Automation libraries (like FlaUI for Windows apps), or PowerShell modules that leverage them.

## VSCode extension

Using Visual Studio Code with the latest PowerShell extension provides a great experience for writing PowerShell code. The extension includes Pester-specific features to improve the way you write, run and debug Pester tests.
